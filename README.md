## Analysis Comment

During this event, the LetsDefend SIEM detected malicious inbound traffic from source IP `112.85.42.13`, which attempted a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack on an internal web server (`172.16.17.17`). The requested URL included JavaScript code aimed at executing an alert box (`<script>javascript:$alert(1)<script>`), which is a typical XSS payload.

Using the LetsDefend Log Management system, it was confirmed that the attack was blocked, with the response showing a status of 302 (redirection), and no damage or compromise occurred. There was no email communication associated with the destination IP, confirming this was not a test scenario.

While no further escalation is needed due to the attack being blocked, the vulnerability allowing the XSS attempt should be investigated and fixed. Input sanitization or other web security measures should be implemented to prevent future XSS attempts.

## Conclusion

This event, captured and analyzed using the LetsDefend platform, highlights a successful defense against an XSS attack targeting a companyâ€™s internal web server. The system effectively blocked the attempt, preventing JavaScript code execution. While no harm was done, it is recommended to address the XSS vulnerability to strengthen overall web security.
